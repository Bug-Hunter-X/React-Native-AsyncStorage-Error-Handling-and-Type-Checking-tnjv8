This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving AsyncStorage: inadequate error handling and type checking. The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file shows the flawed code, which can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior if AsyncStorage operations fail or return unexpected data types. The `AsyncStorageSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes comprehensive error handling and type checking, making the app more robust and reliable. This example highlights the importance of defensive programming in mobile development to prevent runtime errors and enhance the user experience.
